## My Favorite Series: Unreal
Unreal is the series that originated the widely popular Unreal Engine that is used in video games, cinema, engineering, and many more. It was created by Epic Games and Digital Extremes
The first game in the series is an FPS from 1998, simply named *Unreal*. It was a game where it, for its time, had breathtaking graphics and standout weapon design.
*Unreal Tournament* came out the following year, focusing on Unreal's multiplayer aspect, competing with other games such as Quake III Arena in the Arena FPS space.
*Unreal Tournament 2003* released in, you guessed it, 2003, as a sequel to Unreal Tournament, expanding on the gameplay with additional modes and weapons, and unleashing a new generation of graphical fidelity.
*Unreal II: The Awakening* was also released as a sequel to Unreal, with graphical enhancements to raise it to the level of UT 2003.
The next year, *Unreal Tournament 2004* was released. It was more of an expansion to 2003, but was released as a separate game. Its major additions are vehicular combat and large maps for these vehicles, paving the way for Battle Royale games.
With the next game in the series, *Unreal Tournament III*, from 2007, comes the new Unreal Engine 3. This game engine was so good that its most recent release was in 2021, 14 years after its inception.
A reboot of the series, titled Unreal Tournament, was planned for a full release, with its alpha version released on 2014, but with the success of Fortnite Battle Royale, Epic Games shifted its priorities and cancelled the game.
